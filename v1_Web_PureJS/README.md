## Progress:
Still trying to fix the fuck-up that this turned out to be. Currently doesn't work.

### Fix these:
+ ~~*minutes* and *seconds* can be set to above 60.~~ Fixed.
+ ~~in InnerHTML, the values should preferably be displayed in the format 0n if they are below 10.~~ Fixed for minutes and seconds, unsure whether I should do the same for hours.
+ Give warning if input in the wrong format, don't start timer. 

### Do these:
+ Add sound.
+ ~~Toogle Final Rest. The length should be customizable~~ Input for how many workLoops between longBreaks.
+ night mode and day mode



+ Just thought of this but it would be much cooler if instead of layering over #card, the settings div pushed it to the left and went to the right. Rectangle. Maybe use keyframes to animate?
